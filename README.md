The program will calculate and display the average grade for the student entered.
This program demonstrates basic object-oriented principles in Java.
It uses a Student class to encapsulate student data and behavior related to grades.
The Main class handles user input, interacts with the Student class, and calculates the average grade.
It utilizes the Scanner class for input and demonstrates control flow with loops (do-while) and conditional statements (if).
This example can be extended with error handling, input validation, or additional features based on specific requirements.
